I’m guessing on Dec. 15th Trump will begin pressuring Senators and Congresspeople to raise objections.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/iwhtfu/last_of_the_centrelefties/,"Arguments are always worse when they involve family, politics or money. They are especially bad when they contain all three. So it proved when EU leaders sat down this summer for four days of talks about issuing €750bn-worth ($884bn) of common debt. Rather than left versus right, the main fight was left-on-left. Europe’s small band of social-democratic siblings attacked each other. On one side were Portugal and Spain, who wanted the cash handed out as non-repayable grants. Meanwhile, their supposed political allies from Denmark, Sweden and Finland tried to stop them. It is not just money that divides the eu’s dwindling bunch of centre-lefties. Portugal and Spain have both been advocates of allowing more refugees into Europe. Social democrats across Scandinavia demand the numbers are cut. “We won’t tolerate any xenophobic rhetoric,” declared António Costa, the Portuguese prime minister, in one speech. Denmark, meanwhile, calls for control of non-Western immigration. Siblings can often look very different.

What they share, however, is a worry about the family’s future. Alongside Malta, a social-democratic speck in the middle of the Mediterranean, the five countries have the last remaining centre-left leaders in the eu. Their brothers and sisters have fallen on hard times. In France, the Socialists are barely a rump. At the most recent election in the Netherlands the Dutch Labour Party managed to lose three-quarters of its mps. In Germany, the Social Democrats are stuck in an unhappy (and seemingly unending) coalition with Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. By contrast, the social democratic parties of Iberia and Scandinavia are hanging on. Should their relatives be taking notes?

Portugal is the golden child for lefties fed up with being hammered in elections. Mr Costa, Portugal’s barrel-chested leader, has warned of the perils of grand coalitions across the political spectrum. Instead he has opted for a ragbag partnership with an assortment of communists and leftists. Critics labelled it *geringonça* (a “contraption”). But the ungainly device has worked. It raised the minimum wage and reduced the hours that public-sector workers toil. It was not all a socialist dream: the government maintained plans to curb the country’s deficit. Voters still liked what they saw. Last year Mr Costa won re-election and is governing as a minority administration. It was a similar story in Spain. Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s socialist prime minister, once said he “wouldn’t sleep at night” if he made an alliance with Podemos, a more radical left-wing party. A few months later, he had reached a deal with them. A leftward shift, followed by partnership with even leftier rivals, marks the Iberian method.

Others may struggle to follow these tactics. Centre-left parties in Portugal and Spain can rely on a pool of working-class votes that has disappeared in other countries, points out Pedro Magalhães of the University of Lisbon. Whereas challenger parties have sprung up in much of the eu, there are fewer such options in Portugal, where Mr Costa’s Socialists and their centre-right (and oddly named) rivals, the Social Democratic Party, have long dominated the political spectrum. New parties have emerged in Spain, but they have not successfully courted the base of Mr Sánchez’s Socialist Workers’ Party (psoe). Podemos mainly attracted well-educated urban voters, of the tribe that Thomas Piketty calls the “Brahmin left”. psoe’s bedrock of boomers remained solid, even if Podemos did run the party close in 2016. Nationalist anti-immigrant parties such as Vox have made little headway, as Iberia remains largely unperturbed by a debate on immigration that has roiled much of the rest of Europe. Circumstances, then, rather than strategy lurk at the heart of the survival of Iberian socialism. Compared with the rest of the eu, Iberia resembles a political Galapagos island for the centre-left: there are fewer predators, allowing it to evolve in its own peculiar way.

Scandinavia’s situation is more recognisable. Neuralgic issues such as immigration strain the typical base of social-democratic parties, an alliance of the working class and better-educated middle-class professionals. The Danish Social Democrats have, seemingly, had success with a platform of left-wing economics and tough policy on immigration. Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister, spelled out the shift in a speech. In 1980, 1% of people in Denmark were “non-Western”, she explained. Now it is nearly one in ten. Her solution? A limit on “non-Western immigration” into Denmark. But the policy was a vote-swapper, rather than a vote-winner. Whereas some voters came back from the Danish People’s Party, a far-right opposition party, others quit, fed up with the anti-immigration tone. Again it was the so-called Brahmin left who departed. Importantly, points out Karina Kosiara-Pedersen, a professor at Copenhagen University, these voters drifted to other parties on the left. This enabled the Danish Social Democrats to take power in a left-wing coalition, displacing their liberal rivals.

Scepticism about the Danish approach abounds. Straight switchers from centre-left to the populist right are rare, points out Tarik Abou-Chadi from the University of Zurich. Nor is it a viable long-term strategy. Trying to rebuild with the votes of a dwindling traditional working class alone—especially at the expense of a growing band of well-educated, relatively liberal voters—is risky. Rather than reforge the old alliance of the working class and liberal middle class, the Danish method is an admission of defeat.

The days of social-democratic parties mopping up nearly half of all voters, as happened in their post-war peak, are over. Neither the Danish nor the Iberian path is easily copied. What they do demonstrate is that an era of complicated and cumbersome coalitions and pacts looms, with different parts of the centre-left going after different segments of left-wing voters. As the base of centre-left parties fragments, so will the parties themselves. Their family reunions will only become more fractious"

China has placed one million Uighur Muslims in what the UN calls internment camps. But who exactly are the Uighurs and why does China want them “reeducated”?

Reuters: “On January 3, 2020, Dr. Gao Fu, head of China’s disease control agency, informed his U.S. counterpart, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, in an emotional telephone call that the outbreak was growing out of control, according to the same federal official and a former NSC official.

CDC recommendations were ignored by Trump in mid-January as the focus by Mnuchin and Kudlow on keeping the economy going was a priority for Trump’s reelection.

https://www.reddit.com/r/uspolitics/comments/pvywy6/are_centrists_in_the_thrall_of_rightwing/,"Here's the full text of the op-ed:

---

Everyone who paid attention during the Obama years knew that Republicans would also try to undermine Democratic presidencies. Some of the G.O.P.’s actions — notably, the efforts of governors like Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott to prevent an effective response to a deadly pandemic — have shocked even the cynics. Still, a Republican attempt to make President Biden fail, no matter how much it hurt the rest of the country, was predictable.

More surprising, at least to me, has been the self-destructive behavior of Democratic centrists — a term I prefer to “moderates,” because it’s hard to see what’s moderate about demanding that Biden abandon highly popular policies like taxing corporations and reducing drug prices. At this point it seems all too possible that a handful of recalcitrant Democrats will blow up the whole Biden agenda — and yes, it’s the centrists who are throwing a tantrum, while the party’s progressives are acting like adults.

So what’s motivating the sabotage squad? Part of the answer, I’d argue, is that they have internalized decades of right-wing economic propaganda, that their gut reaction to any proposal to improve Americans’ lives is that it must be unworkable and unaffordable.

Of course, this isn’t the whole story. We certainly shouldn’t underrate the influence of money: Both wealthy donors and Big Pharma have been nakedly throwing their weight around. Nor should we discount the importance of simple innumeracy: $3.5 trillion sounds like a lot of money, and you shouldn’t assume politicians understand (or think constituents understand) that this is proposed spending over the course of a decade, not a single year. It would amount to little more than 1 percent of gross domestic product over that period and would still leave overall government spending far below its level in other wealthy democracies. It also ignores the fact that the true cost, after net savings and new revenue, would be much less than $3.5 trillion.

And some politicians seem to suffer from the misguided notion that only spending on “hard” infrastructure, like roads and bridges, counts as investing in the nation’s future. That is, they haven’t caught up with the growing body of evidence for high economic returns to spending on people — especially spending that lifts children out of poverty.

Still, I often find myself surprised to hear politicians and pundits who don’t consider themselves part of movement conservatism peddling economic narratives that are nothing more than right-wing propaganda but have been repeated so many times that many people who should know better accept them as established fact.

I frequently hear, for example, that runaway spending and budget deficits caused the stagflation of the 1970s. In reality, federal debt shrank as a share of G.D.P. over the course of that decade (only to soar under President Ronald Reagan). To the extent that we understand ’70s stagflation, it seems to have been caused by a combination of oil shocks and feckless monetary policy. Big government had nothing to do with it.

I also sometimes hear even centrists giving Reagan’s tax cuts credit for turning the U.S. economy around. The truth is that most Americans did worse in the decades after the Reagan tax cuts than in the corresponding previous period; the post-Reagan boom, such as it was, was limited to a small number of wealthy people.

Finally, it’s amazing how many people believe that European economies with high social spending are severely damaged by reduced incentives to work. It’s true that during the 1980s and 1990s much of the Continent seemed to suffer from “Eurosclerosis” — persistent high unemployment, even during periods of economic expansion. But that was a long time ago. These days generous welfare states often have better labor market performance than the United States.

Take the example of Denmark, which Fox Business at one point compared to Venezuela. Indeed, if there were any truth to right-wing dogma, Denmark should be an economic hellhole. It has vastly higher social spending than we do; two-thirds of its workers are union members, and those unions are so powerful that they forced McDonald’s to pay its workers $22 an hour.

But the reality is that working-age Danes are more likely than their American counterparts to have jobs. It’s true that real G.D.P. per capita is slightly lower in Denmark, but that’s mainly because Denmark, unlike the U.S., isn’t a no-vacation nation; the Danes actually do take some time off from work.

The point is that as far as I can tell, those troublesome Democratic centrists are blinded by an economic narrative that was deliberately created to block progress and justify vast inequality. So they imagine that the Biden agenda — which is a fairly modest effort to address our nation’s very real problems — is somehow irresponsible and a threat to the nation’s future.

I would urge them to reconsider their premises. Biden’s proposed spending isn’t irresponsible and wouldn’t hurt growth. On the contrary, it would be deeply irresponsible not to invest in people as well as concrete, and if you look at the evidence, rather than repeating right-wing dogma, you realize that Biden’s agenda is actually pro-growth."

Jan 6th ended any shot Trump had a comeback victory because while it did not cost him what should have been tens of millions of voters it did cost him hundreds of thousands of voters after an election he only lost by a few hundred thousand in key states. Plus, if he runs in 2024 it will fire up the Democratic base like nothing else does.

Yet even not running, Trump is a danger. It is beyond assured that he will want a part in deciding who does run and will seek out some loyal Trump ally. Only thing is, the MAGA Morons have repeatedly shown they *ONLY* support Trump and have consistently failed to turn out the vote for those he endorses. Much of it the result of Trump being incapable of talking about anyone other than himself. 

His rallies for two craven idiots who were fighting to remain in the Senate in the Janauary runoff in Georgia turned into trainwrecks with Trump refusing to stick to the script and even casting doubt on the outcome.

https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/j65kww/denial_of_cert_davis_v_ermold/,"> The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.

Many will be familiar with this case: Kim Davis, a former county clerk for Rowan County Kentucky, gained attention in August 2015 when she defied a US federal court order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Davis claimed to have religious objections to this request, objections that were not adequately addressed by the Court's ruling in OBERGEFELL. 

The Court issued their denial of cert in Monday's Order List. Notable is the statement (starting on page 55) by Justice Thomas (and joined by Justice Alito) concurring in the denial of cert but raising important questions about the scope of their decision in OBERGEFELL. Justice Thomas refers to same-sex marriage as ""a novel constitutional right"", re-asserting that the OBERGEFELL decision will have “ruinous consequences for religious liberty.”

My takeaway: Thomas raises several interesting concerns around the OBERGEFELL decision and finding a balance between religious liberty and same-sex marriage. Given that only 2 of the 8 Justices signed on to this statement, I think it's safe to say that the core aspects of OBERGEFELL (and therefore same-sex marriage) are here to stay."

Unless something *drastically* changes in Trump's favor, I just don't see the path emerging.

This is not 2016. Most polls have been adjusted to account for the main sources of error in 2016 (under-counting non-college educated whites). Biden is polling above 50% in many states, which is very different to Hillary's mid-40's. There are far fewer third-party or undecided voters in these polls. The polling is incredibly consistent.

I came across this article on r/news and I wanted a more moderate approach to trying to dissect the reasoning for the White house to not allow the CDC to assist in contact tracing. 

There are many theories about it, but I do find it concerning that the white house is not being more proactive to implement contact tracing as many of their own party would more than likely get a severe case due to age and comorbidities. 

I would have thought that the GOP in general would be a lot more careful as they have already had prominent members pass after contracting the virus.

In the case of an objection, the Joint Session recesses and each chamber considers the objection separately in a session which cannot last more than two hours with each Member speaking for no more than five minutes. After each house votes on whether or not to accept the objection, the Joint Session reconvenes and both chambers disclose their decisions. If they agree to the objection, the votes in question are not counted. If either chamber does not agree with the objection, the votes are counted.
Objections to the Electoral College votes were recorded in 1969 and 2005.

For example, how many of us would voluntarily agree to keyloggers and other productivity monitoring software on our work computers? After all, we did all agree to work from 8 until 5, so tracking the fact that we're doing exactly what was agreed to is fine, right?

There have to be good ways to monitor and manage police interactions with citizens without making the officer feel like he or she is on trial every minute they're in uniform.    I like body cams, but the procedures and training need to catch up to how we want police to behave. Otherwise, you're just playing a game of ""gotcha.""

Accountability coupled with clear procedures and adequate training would go a long way toward improving policing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/j6fczu/progressives_to_biden_stop_dragging_bernie_hes/,"Biden has done a fair bit of coordination with Bernie, AOC, and the progressive left when it comes to crafting his platform and I’m sure Biden will incorporate some of these views when he appoints his cabinet. 

Unlike what some media personalities may think, Biden saying he beat Bernie isn’t that divisive of a statement to most dem voters. He needs to respond to baseless attacks from the right."
https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/j6fczu/progressives_to_biden_stop_dragging_bernie_hes/,"Biden: I was never a socialist. Here are my policies and I’m sorry they are not your ideal. I beat Bernie. Most Democrats voted for me and I handily won the primary.

DSA: How dare you! 🤯

Everyone else: So you good with another 4 years of Trump or are you ridin with Biden?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/j6fczu/progressives_to_biden_stop_dragging_bernie_hes/,"Bernie, his campaign and fans have spent last 5 years attacking, villanizing and criticizing democrats of all hues, levels and believes. But when in rare case, Biden feels the need to distance himself from far left's impossible policies or impractical positioning, far left gets angry at him. 

If far left has not proposed utterly expensive and almost impossible policies like GND/ Single Payer that bans private insurance, and not have shown affinity for leftists authoritarians, rest of the democrats will not be forced in a position to separate themselves from such policies. 

I hope the sensible and mature far left supporters, realize that most of their policy proposals are not acceptable beyond deep blue districts. Hell, even Vermont hasn't bought into a single major policy pushed by Bernie."
https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/j6fczu/progressives_to_biden_stop_dragging_bernie_hes/,"TL;DR: Progressives are upset at Biden for denouncing socialism, M4A, and affirming ""I beat Bernie/the socialist!"" on 6 different occasions now. They still plan to vote for him though."
https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberty/comments/gahxbt/how_poor_sleep_is_causing_nighttime_leakage/,"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant.     Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.     Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberty/comments/hateei/mass_incarceration_deprives_people_of_their/,"The United States has less than 5% of the world’s population, yet nearly 25% of its prisoners. Mass incarceration has crushing consequences — racial, economic, social — and it doesn’t make us safer.

Mass incarceration rips apart families and communities, disproportionately hurts people of color, and costs taxpayers $260 billion a year. At the same time, crime continues to drop to 30-year lows — and harsh punishments aren’t the reason.

We are at a tipping point. To end mass incarceration, we need alternatives to prison for violent crimes.

Polls are mostly run by the MSM and lib groups.  They can be used to motivate their voters or depress Republicans.  It all depends on how they ask the question and who they ask the questions to.  Weigh the poll one way and ask in a certain way and you get the results you want.  Do not be discouraged or become complacent by what the media reports, the polls say or what you see on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or what your co-workers are saying.  The only poll that matters is the one AFTER Election Day. I can almost guarantee you the polls will start to tighten as we get closer to 11/3.  First that will spur the D’s to vote as they see Trump gaining and they hope it will make you, less eager to vote.

What I mean here is the idea of “gender roles” that a woman stays home with the children and takes care of the household and the man goes out and works. Especially as more and more women began going into the work force and men were staying home as stay at home dads. 

I understood that idea and even agreed with it to an extent as far as those roles being socially constructed for specific genders.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conservatives/comments/oxbob5/could_it_be/,"I mean this with all due respect: Conservatives really need to stop using ""communism"" as their all-purpose boogie-man.  It may have worked in the 50s and 60s, but it doesn't now.  Anyone under 50 has absolutely no idea what you're talking about, or why you're obsessed with it.  In fact... and again, all due respect... it sounds kind of silly and a little crazy, like the ""old man shouting at clouds"" meme.

At the moment, the only ""communist"" Nation that most people know anything about is China, and they're kicking our ass in every measurable way.  So when you use the word ""communism"", it makes you sound hopelessly out of touch, like someone desperately trying to use out-of-date slang in a doomed attempt to sound cool.  Most millennials look at America and see a country currently wallowing in a downward spiral of fear, failure, and debt.  They look at China and see a Nation that's moved from Third World to First World almost overnight, and is currently doing all the cool, wonderful things that we used to do, but no longer even attempt to do.

They're building the world's biggest skyscrapers.  They're building the world's biggest statues.  They're planning manned moon landings and renovating their cities.  And they're getting us to pay for it, while our own Nation crumbles around us into anarchy and decay.

So it's pretty hard to sound anything but stuck in the past and clueless about the nature of the modern world if you insist on screaming about ""commies"".  Nobody here has a bomb shelter.  Very few of us lived through the Cuban missile crisis.  Most of us see the Vietnam war as a huge mistake.  So you're probably doing more harm than good by continuing to fear-monger over something that nobody is currently afraid of."

It is not as cut and dry as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, I am a Democrat, but please at least hear me out. Disagree with me if you want, but at least hear me out first.

  
The Supreme Court never said why they struck down the moratorium, meaning it could go either way. For all we know, the new order fixes the problems they had with it.

  
Lower courts have have struck down the order because it was was issued under a public health statue which gives the CDC the power to prevent the transmission of disease. Since this new order only applies in areas with high or substantial transmission rates, it may be easier to make a compelling argument that the order accomplishes that goal. By contrast, the old order applied nationwide, meaning that it some cases it may not even prevent the spread of diseases, as the statue giving the CDC power to issues orders requires. 

  
If the CDC can convince a court that the order prevents the transmission of disease, it will likely be upheld, which is likely why this one is more focused. It could, however, go either way, depending on how a specific judge sees things. Eventually, it will make it back to the Supreme Court, and as I said we don't know why they struck it down it the first place."
